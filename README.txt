This is my github which contains some of my work. The SSI_Portfolio repository contains a sample of my work with python in the form of 6 different programs. The programs titled sierpinkski and sierpinkski2 are both programs that utilize a recursive algorithm to create sierpinkski triangles (the version two adds random colors to that triangle). The program entitled anagrams takes file input from a list of words as well as a string of letters and returns all the words from that list that can be formed with the given letter or, simply put, it finds the anagrams for a string of letters. The file titled dna take in a file containing several letter sequences, and then analyzes those sequences to determine if they contain valid DNA data and if so, if those DNA sequences encode a protein; the results are then printed to another file so that they can be saved. The file entitled speedreader takes in a passage from a text file and then displays the words at a certain pace with special colors determined by the word being displayed (in quotes, etc), in order to make reading the passage more efficient. The final file in this repository which is entitled grammar takes in data from a file formatted a specific way and uses that data to generate a random expression (expr). To do this it creates a dictionary using the formatted data wherein some values are associated with another value in the dictionary (for example "noun" may be associated with "cat" and "dog." In essence the code runs until all selected words have no reference and then returns the sentence that they form. The my repositories titled Lumberjack and Space contain python code to make two different arcade style games.
